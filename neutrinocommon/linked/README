In this folder I have place copies of the following programs:

- nusigma
- hepmc
- tauola

NUSIGMA is needed for the differential cross sections. I have modified the make files in order to make it independend of DARKSUSY. Now NUSIGMA-MOD compiles as a stand alone.

HEPMC and TAUOLA are needed for the taudecay which is a cython interface to TAUOLA.
